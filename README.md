### About Me üëã

> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) | [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4597704/joe) | [WordPress](https://iwritecodesometimes.net/)

Hello! My name is Joe Meyer; Full-time developer, part-time hobby-jogger, Tsar of awful check-in comments. I like cooking, exploring Chicago, and a good story. I write code sometimes.

In fact, I‚Äôve been writing code sometimes since about 2010; typically JavaScript, C#, CSS, and other things related to function and form for web and phone apps, both native and HTML-based. Recently, I‚Äôve taken a particular shine to React Native and other technologies that make cross-platform native possible from a single code base. I like to blog about the things I learn at a little company called [Rightpoint](https://www.rightpoint.com/) as well as the cool stuff I learn on my own time.

Ask me about good restaurants in Chicago. I dine out sometimes.
